    <h1>Gabe's Favorite Game</h1>
    <h2>Elden Ring</h2>
    <p>Elden Ring is set in the Lands Between, where the demigods have shattered the Elden Ring,
        a cosmic artifact that governs reality. As a Tarnished, a once-exiled warrior, you are called
        back to the Lands Between to gather the shattered Great Runes, restore the Elden Ring, and become the new Elden
        Lord.
        The player's quest involves defeating the demigod children of the former Queen Marika, who are now corrupted by
        power,
        and ultimately deciding the fate of the world</p>
    /br
    <p>I loved Elden Ring for its masterful combination of open-world exploration with the challenging and deep combat
        FromSoftware is known for,
        creating a sense of wonder and accomplishment</p>
